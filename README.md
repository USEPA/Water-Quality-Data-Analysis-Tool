 The WQP Data Analysis tool is a desktop application that provides an easy to use interface allowing users to analyze data that has been exported from the WQP Data Discovery Tool, or other similar applicaiton. The tool uses open source R, a statistical programming language and several add-on packages, to compare the data against water quality criteria, determine trends, and visualize that analysis.
